1: It was not the partly intangible attacks on my “Primordial Cell” that did not make me tire in my efforts to establish certain new geological facts: it was the observation of the untenability of the previous view in the most undisputedly important part of the geological science, in the part through which it is related to the cosmos — that is, the doctrine of the so-called plutonic rocks.

If, in the first part of my "Primordial Cell" I had tolerated the doctrine, and with resignation accepted that the core of the Earth - and thus also that the knowledge of the real genesis of our Earth will always be hidden from us - then, at the end of this book, there is now a view: the meteorite reveals a distant passage, which no researcher has yet dared.
