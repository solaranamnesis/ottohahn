DIE METEORITE (CHONDRITE) IHRE ORGANISMEN by Dr. Otto Hahn (1880)
"The chondrite meteorites and their organisms"

My attempt at translation from the original German to English (with the help of Google Translator)

... Hahn in a private letter to a friend claimed "Darwin pronounced: it is one of the most important elucidations ever made." Strangely also in the Science article of 1881 other very Darwin-unlike behavior appears. Supposedly Darwin, observing under the microscope the rock fragments, jumped from his seat exclaiming ''Almighty God! What a wonderful discovery! Wonderful!'' and stating that indeed "life [came] down!'' from space. [https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/history-of-geology/charles-darwin-and-the-early-search-for-extraterrestrial-life/]
