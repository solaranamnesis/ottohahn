## Background:

"In the August 1881 issue of the New York magazine Science there is a long overlooked article entitled "Mr. Darwin on Dr. Hahn's Discovery of Fossil Organisms in Meteorites." Science was founded the preceding year by journalist John Michels with financial backing of Thomas Edison. Struggling to find a place in the popular science market, the illustrated weekly magazine was only published until March 1882. The current journal of the same name is a later incarnation. The article contains some extraordinary quotations from a lost Darwin letter or letters and, even more surprisingly, spoken words attributed to Darwin upon viewing meteorite specimens. The passage reads:

Not content with the mere presentation of his work, Dr. Hahn visited the veteran zoologist and brought his preparations to him for inspection.
No sooner had Mr. Darwin peered through the microscope on one of the finest specimens when he started up from his seat and exclaimed:
'Almighty God! What a wonderful discovery! Wonderful!'
And after a pause of silent reflection he added: 'Now reaches life down!'
The latter remark no doubt refers to the proof furnished by Dr. Hahn's discovery that organisms can reach our planet from celestial space. It is an acknowledgment of the relief Mr. Darwin must have felt in not being forced to a belief in a primeval 'generatio equivoca'.

Could this be true? Did Darwin really leap out of his chair? Did he believe life on Earth came from outer space?"

### Full Text of "Mr. Darwin on Dr. Hahn's Discovery of Fossil Organisms in Meteorites" from August 1881 issue of Science:

Dr. Hahn's discovery, of which an elaborate account was given in No. 50 of Science, has stirred up a lively discussion of this highly interesting subject. Dr. Hahn has taken steps to enable Prof. von Quenstedt, the renowned Tubingen geologist, and all others who expressed the desire to examine his microscopic preparations. It is understood that all those who have availed themselves of the opportunity thus offered have become convinced of the genuineness of Dr. Hahn's discovery.

It is very interesting to note the position taken by the greatest of living evolutionists in this controversy, if it can still be called such. Charles Darwin, on receipt of Dr. Hahn's work, wrote to him:

"... It seems to be very difficult to doubt that your photographs exhibit organic structure...," and furthermore:

"... your discovery is certainly one of the most important."

Not content with the mere presentation of his work, Dr. Hahn visited the veteran zoologist and brought his preparations to him for inspection.

No sooner had Mr. Darwin peered through the microscope on one of the finest specimens when he started up from his seat and exclaimed:

"Almighty God! What a wonderful discovery! Wonderful!"

And after a pause of silent reflection he added:

"Now reaches life down!"

The latter remark no doubt refers to the proof furnished by Dr. Hahn's discovery that organisms can reach our planet from celestial space. It is an acknowledgment of the relief Mr. Darwin must have felt in not being forced to a belief in a primeval _"generatio equivoca."_

As was suggested in the paper referred to, "the Richter-Thomson hypothesis of the origin of life on the earth has become a tangible reality!"

Arrhenius and Merrill make no mention of the organic theory in 1906 and 1920, suggesting that the works of Hahn/Karsten/Weinland were forgotten/ignored by this time in the "accepted" literature on the chondrites.
