# THE METEORITE (CHONDRITE) AND ITS ORGANISMS

#### Translation note:

I take Hahn's perspective while translating and try to convey his point as best I can. I feel his argument is that of a lawyer and as such, I try to follow suit. I believe he considered this discovery to be of the highest order: the first modern realization that humanity, and the Earth in general, is being visited by alien representatives daily, albeit of a fossil variety.

I prefer updating the terms to reflect the modern nomenclature. I only wanted a good read and I don't consider this as a professional translation. When I saw that Hahn's book was never published in English, and since I really like reading historical material, I thought I could have fun and translate it myself to get the gist of what he was saying about meteorites. This is only public in the case that others with native skills would help, with the result that the final effort may be free and available online. This is an excellent work with incredible microphotographs at high magnifications (consider the collodion process was invented in 1851, the gelatin dry plate in 1871, this book published in 1880). You can tell the author went through a lot of hard work to bring it all together, as he himself emphasizes. He seemed determined to show people the truth about meteorites.

# 1:

It was not the inconsequential attacks on my "Primordial Cell" that made me tire in my efforts to establish certain new geological facts, but rather it was the untenability of the previous views regarding the most undisputedly important part of the geological sciences, in the part through which it is related to the cosmos — that is, the doctrine of the so-called plutonic rocks.

If, in the first part of my "Primordial Cell" I had tolerated the doctrine, and with resignation accepted that the core of our Earth and also the knowledge pertaining to its real genesis will always be hidden from us - then, at the end of this book, then there is now an alternative: the meteorite, which reveals a distant time window, where no researcher has yet ventured.

With this as my guide I now continue.

I did this, accompanied on the one hand with the sharply pronounced sarcasm of the specialists, and on the other by my joy with earlier results and the now daily support and counsel from the few friends whom I have succeeded in convincing.

The results yielded from this strenuous effort of almost super human endeavor over the previous year are laid down in the following pages.

It is a world of life in a rock which fell to Earth and brought us tidings of the smallest beings from the most distant places - a life world which a mortal eye could hardly hope to behold: a world of beings showing us the creative power that made our Earth out of a nebula and has worked everywhere and evenly in the universe.

Admittedly, the meteorites, namely the chondrites, for these are the ones which are preferentially subject to my investigations, have no life of higher construction; instead, all are lower life forms - the same ones which prevail in the Silurian strata - sponges, corals, and crinoids - it is with these species that similar characteristics are found.

The chondrites that I have studied are olivine enstatite rock. They have undergone alterations, though not considerable, since the time of their formation as the remains of life and up until they landed here. They have been permeated with a silicate solution, in a similar manner to how the Jura deposits are with a solution of lime. While it was part of the parent body, it probably went through planetary cycles just as new layers follow old ones down to the lowest strata of our Earth, under the influence of which the former have undergone a certain, though not so considerable transformation as one usually assumes.

Only the surface of the meteorites have changed considerably, and indeed only at the last moment of their planetesimal existence, and mostly due to the influence of frictional heat created, in this case, by the Earth's atmosphere. But the original meteorite itself essentially remains. We now see that before us is a piece of a planet as it was in the process of becoming, and thus the history of our Earth's body is now open to us, provided that we are correct that the meteorites, in their formation, are homogeneous in their chemical composition with the same world matter which formed the Earth and vice versa. At the same time, by sending me the "Meteorite of Ovifak" (I owe it to the kindness of Professor Dr. von Nordenskjöld) I was offered the opportunity to bring this rock into the investigation.

I consider it to be earthly - as the deepest layer our Earth, i.e. the olivine layer, which belongs under the granite. I call the original layer the Olivine Formation. Since the rock is very similar to a meteorite, it was natural to declare it to be the same. The reasons why I do not consider it to be meteoritic but true to the Earth's core are laid down in this book.

Thus, we have established two solid points, from which a lever can be set.

The chondrites, an olivine-feldspar (enstatite) rock, consists of an animal world, they are not part of a layer of sedimentary rock, nor a conglomerate, but a thick mat of animals, a tissue whose meshes were all once living beings, and life of the lowest kind, the beginnings of creation.

However, I could not make a systematic enumeration of life which is preserved in the meteorites: I just wanted to prove that _it is_ - _here it is_. I therefore only depicted the organic beings which I could content myself with determining undoubtedly, on the one hand the genera which coincide with terrestrial forms and, on the other, separating out the specifically meteoritic forms, while leaving both for future investigation.

It is to be expected that my enumeration will be, through further research and with the help of richer material than I have available, multiplied and supplemented. In particular, sudivisions had to be avoided: since every newly discovered being would overturn any divisions and make the effort arduous, and any work in vain.

This was the reason why I only made large divisions, and these only to the extent that this contributed to the understanding of the forms. I repeat, the work in this direction should not be considered exhaustive and complete.

In other ways I have also made an indulgence, such as in the demarcation of the main divisions themselves.

Anyone who even superficially surveys the forms will soon find that they provide the actual history of development. All the transitions from the sponge to the coral, from the coral to the crinoid are present, so that it becomes really doubtful if one should assign new species to to these transitions.

In such beginnings, mistakes are inevitable, so it is only a small demand to ask to forgive them. Nor did I want to delay the publication of this work too long, and therefore have it just as it is now available.

## Section 1

### Previous Views On the Meteorite

### History and Overview

Last year, when I wrote down in my diary certain new observations about the composition of the rocks of our Earth and finally also of the meteorities, the importance of the latter to geology was not fully clear to me.

It was only when I was forced by the attacks of opponents to take the investigation again into my hands, that I clearly realized the importance that a careful study of meteorites could be to the history of our Earth. Lastly, I came to the conclusion that, in the present state of geology, the meteorities - and only the meteorites, give the point from which the history of the Earth could at least be explored with almost certainty.

If, in the "Primordial Cell", I thought I had reached the limit of research with granite, I soon learned better. I contemplated that by virtue of its specific gravity, our Earth's core must also consist of at least solid iron, further considering the very probable order in the meteorites, which goes from pure iron to the feldspar rocks of our earth. I further believed that a conclusion from our Earth on the meteorites could be ventured, the conclusion that in the other planets and in those, or the one whose debris we have in the hundred thousand of orbiting meteorites before us, a sequence of stratification from heavy to light, a stratigraphy which we probably pass through in the series from pure iron through the half iron (Pallasite, Hainwood) to the chondrites and eucrites, then to the coal meteorites (Cold Bokkeveld) in front of us.

Once this probability had been gained, it was obvious that the meteorites should be subjected to a thorough examination of their morphological characteristics. This was also highly necessary, because so far almost nothing had happened in this direction: one can convince oneself of this by comparing my illustrations with the roughly twenty meager images, which taken together form the material of the science today. The academic writings of Berlin, Vienna, and Munich have only a few panels each, the drawings are small, and it immediately shows, are taken from the least suitable meteorites for this direction of investigation and, moreover, probably not from the best part, the interior.

So if, I thought, my earlier assertion that the Knyahinya Meteorite consisted entirely of life, was not confirmed by my new investigations, then science would have still been served if I were to show the true form of this meteorite. Fortunately, however, I was spared this retreat: on the contrary the result of the new research was far beyond expectations — a new world emerged.

But, of course - our science is doubtful - it rightly demands more stringent evidence than I offered in my "Primordial Cell"; a book written more at the stage of, I would say, intuition. Today I present that evidence.

As one examines the panels of this work, it immediately becomes certain that these are not mineral forms, but organic forms, that we have before us the images of life, images of life of the lowest order, a creation which, in greater part, finds some of its closest relatives on Earth - with regard to the corals and crinoids, this is determined with absolute certainty; however, the sponges only have a little such similarity with the forms of the terrestrial genera of the Earth.

Thus, the origin was established with regard to the parts. However, in my study of 20 chondrites (and 360 thin sections of them), the assertion made in my "Primordial Cell" confirmed that the rock of the chondrites is not a type of sedimentary rock as on our Earth, in which fossils are embedded, that it is not a conglomerate formation; rather, its whole mass is entirely formed of organic beings, like our coral rocks. So not plant, as I assumed earlier, but Pflanzenthiere! The whole stone a life: — I think science will forgive me the first mistake.

Needless to say, the meteoric iron was now subject to another test. Here it remained at my first observation.

However, time and circumstances, especially the lack of available materials prevented me from concluding the investigation prior to this publication. But if I repeat today the first assertion that the meteoritic iron is nothing but a mat of plants, then I may now regard myself as more legitimate than at the time when I wrote the “Primordial Cell” in asserting the prior statement. I have to add that I also found life forms in iron. The researchers who avoided the forms of chondrites that I depict may have overlooked the fact that the so-called Widmanstätten's figures are, for the most part, plant cells and not crystals.

The investigations up till now, in the whole field, with the exception of [Karl Wilhelm von] Gümbel's work in the Munich Academy, are of litte use, both regarding their accuracy of observation and even more as regards the interpretations based upon those observations, on unproven hypotheses and weak assumptions - not suitable for scientific findings as such. And due to this the field was still wide open to me, although my only regret is that I cannot make a draft in time regarding the iron.

I now come to the conclusions for geography. If the chondrites, an olivine and enstatite rock, are really what I assure: that is, only pieces of sponge-coral-crinoid rock, then a fact of immeasurable consequence has been discovered for the science of our Earth.

A feldspar mineral is purely a water production, it is petrifying matter of millions of organisms! Thus, all hypotheses about the metamorphic and plutonic rocks of our Earth fall, and with them the theory of the fire-liquid Earth interior — at least no conclusion can be drawn from the rocks any more.

I have to justify this now. The comparison of rocks from Earth with the meteorites shows that the chondrite, at least according to its chemical nature, has its closest relatives on the Earth.

The olivine rock of our Earth is, as a Lherzolite, a bedrock layer as we see with basalt breaking through the granite; I arrive at these results which [Gabriel Auguste] Daubrée has shown.

The deeper granite is definitely younger than the olivine. But if the olivine of the meteorites, by virtue of its composition, is a water-rock, it will probably be the granite of our Earth; if the olivine of the meteorites is the remains of life, the then same will be the case with the olivine of the Earth: it could probably be concluded that this rock of our Earth is also composed in its original deposits of the same life as that of the chondrites. And for the same reason the granite, as younger rock, will probably have a similar origin. If we have to see in our Swabian basalt only leaching from the ogiinal olivine, then the bedrock of Lherzolite is found under the granite. And even if this rock appears as a deposit of liquid without distinguishable forms, then the iron of Ovifak has such; but this is much connected with the basalt, so intimately, and not only mechanically, that both must be regarded as one rock. So this is the original olivine bedrock. But with this, the scientific reason is removed from the assumption of the origin of the Earth by way of fire.

If the surface of the planets or of the planets consists of layers of olivine from life, then the same layers of our Earth were probably not formed by fire, at least there is not the slightest reason for this supposition, on the contrary, it should be assumed that the same layer of the Earth was a water formation. Here I encounter the Kant-Laplace theory.

I imagine that the planetary materials (including water, which is usually overlooked) during the first mass formation were not, as [Immanuel] Kant and [Pierre-Simon] Laplace say, a glowing haze, but rather a vapor and mass cold as space. Here, however, one has overlooked a great logical error in the above mentioned theory.

The attraction of mass should form the mass! The effect should be the cause simultaneously! The mass is to be formed by mass attraction, that is, by the fact that it was already there! It is to be regretted that this error of thought has not been discovered earlier. The mass, when it is present, can increase by attraction, but not by it: it is as if someone should be his own father!

So another force had to form the mass; but this could only be either the crystallization force or the organic formative force. The former does not suffice to explain the formation of the planets, and no crystals are found: consequently only the second force remains - the organic one. Here I recall my observations of the structure of the meteorite and so today, for me at least, it is clear that the first beginnings of our Earth, like the rest of the planet, has an organic cause.

If the sentence also appears a bit deafening, one need only resort to the familiar.

First, the mass of building materials available at the beginning of planetary formation is completely sufficient to explain the formation of the planetary mass in an organic way.

Secondly, the experience of today shows how in a short time the lowest plants and animals multiply their number, including their mass, in a way that is conditioned only by the mass of building materials, while their organization itself makes it possible to expand into infinity as long as building materials are present.

What seems to contradict this explanation is only the geothermal heat and the associated appearance of the volcanoes still active today. With regard to these two facts, one has long been led back to a different explanation, that of the liquid-fire Earth interior. The water has a dissolving effect on feldspar. In this dissolving process, heat is released. The volcanoes follow the sea because the water helps form the gases, which ignited from above, melt the forthcoming rock.

How could a fiery Earth core ultimately survive without oxygen! And does not the very existence of combustible gases (for these are the causes of volcanic phenomena), in particular that of sulphur gases, indicate the presence of oragnic substances in the Earth's interior? There really is no need for new evidence here, but only the abandonment of certain ideas, which have taken possession of the imagination excited by some obvious phenomena.

These are the conclusions from the study of the meteorites for our Earth's formation. But the facts which astronomy can derive from it are no more significant.

The 20 meteorite (chondrite) thin sections that I have studied, some of falls which are more than a century apart, show the same forms, much as a fossil-shells occurs everywhere in the same formation; [Karl Wilhelm von] Gümbel, if he did not correctly interpret the forms of the chondrites, has excellently expressed this.

So these chondrites are probably from one and the same world body, a planet. Or, has evolution been so much the same on different planets?

This planet carries water life, so life has arisen in water and lives by water; the planet has not passed through fire, because the traces of fire do not show in these rocks. The meteorite, having been shattered, only receives a 1 mm thick enamel fushion crust in its short path through our atmosphere, as a result frictional heat.

The life of the chondrite is almost entirely a microscopic one, it ranges from 0.20 to a maximum of 3 mm in diameter, often it takes a magnification of 1000 to clearly see the delicate structures, while at such magnifcation our [terrestrial] fossils dissolve into a shapeless surface.

Thus, through the observations first laid down in my "Primordial Cell", a path was wide open for me to cover the distances our science must cross.

But it really didn't take a titanium force to overthrow the old building. It had already been much worn, only ignored: it requires only one striking proof and the work will have been done. Traditions, based on insufficient observations, dissolve into what they are, allowing science to once again proceed freely on its course.

The following is a brief presentation on the previous views regarding the origin and nature of the meteorites.

Only the morphological work on individual meteorites, from the time when the microscope began to be used in geology, should be enumerated. What the microscope has so far provided for the interpretation of the meteorites is, apart from the enlarged olivine crystals in [Nikolai Ivanovich] Koksharov's "Minerals of Russia VI", is contained in the following writings:

1. [Gustav] Tschermak [von Seysenegg]: the fragmentary structure of the Orvinio and Chantonnay meteorites, presented at the meeting of the Royal Academy of Sciences (Vienna) on November 12, 1874. (XXth volume of the proceedings of the Royal Academy of Sciences, I. Section, November issue 1874. With 2 plates.)

2. [Alexander] Makowsky and [Gustav] Tschermak [von Seysenegg]: Report on the fall of a meteorite near Zischitz in Moravia. With 5 plates and 2 woodcuts, presented at the meeting of the mathematical and natural science class (the Royal Academy of Sciences in Vienna) on November 21, 1878. XXIX. Volume of memoranda of the mentioned class.

3. [Johann Gottfried] Galle and [Arnold Constantin Peter Franz] von Lasaulx, submitted by [Christian Friedrich Martin] Websky: Report on the Meteorite Fall at Gnadenfrei on May 17, 1879. Session of July 31, 1879. Monthly reports of the Royal Prussian Academy of Berlin.

The previous descriptions are limited to examinations with the naked eye and the magnifying glass, as well as chemical analysis.

They all agree that the chondrites consist of a matrix of spheres of enstatite (bronzite), olivine and iron, nickel and chromium iron.

[Karl Wilhelm von] Gümbel: On the stone meteorites found in Bavaria; Meeting reports of the mathematical-physical class of the Munich Royal Academy of Sciences 1878. Issue 1, p. 14 et seq. In the description of the meteorites of Eichstädt and Schöneberg, he mentioned “Maschenstructur” (p. 27. 46). However, he also speaks of "descendants of larger broken chondrules" (p. 28). The important section of his observations is on page 58, which follows here:

"If one examines the results of the investigation of this, albeit limited, group of stone meteorites, then the perception that comes to the fore is that, in spite of some difference in the nature of their conglomeration, they are nevertheless governed by completely identical structural relations. All are undoubtedly debris, composed of small and larger mineral grains, from the well known roundish chondrules: which are usually completely preserved, but often appear broken as pieces, to the globs of metallic meteoritic substances, sulfur iron, and chromium iron. All these fragments are glued together, not cemented by an intermediate substance or by a binder, as there are no amorphous, glassy or lava admixtures at all. Only the fusion crust and black constrictions, which often appear on clefts and are similar to the crust, consist of amorphous glass, which, however, originated after falling within our atmosphere. In this melted crust, the heavier meltable and larger mineral grains are usually still embedded unmelted. The mineral splinters do not bear any traces of rounding or unrolling, they are sharp-edged and pointed. As for the chondrules, their surface is not smooth, as it would have been if they were the product of a roll, rather it is always uneven, mulberry-like, and warty or multifaceted with a projection of crystalline surfaces. Many of them are elongated, with a distinct rejuvenation or sharpening in one direction, as is the case with hailstones. Often you encounter pieces, which apparently have to be regarded as parts of shattered chondrules. As an exception are twin-like connected beads, more commonly those in which meteoritic iron beads have grown. In numerous thin sections they are composed differently. Most often there is an excentric, radiating fibrous structure which spreads from a point far from the center after tapering or slightly tattered lines spread like rays towards the outside. Since cuts made at various angles always reveal columnar or needle-shaped arrangement, never leaves or lamellas in the substance forming these tufts, it seems to be columnar fibers from which such chondrules are built up. With certain cuts, according to this assuption, in the cross-sections of the fibers which are perpendicular to the length direction, only irregularly angular, minute fields are observed, as if the whole was composed of small polyhedral granules. Sometimes they appear as if there were several systems radiating in different directions in a sphere, or as if the point of radiation were changed during its formation, so that a constant and seemingly confused elongated structure emerges. Towards the outside, against which the junction point of the radiating bundle is shifted unilaterally, the fiber structure normally becomes indistinct or replaced by a more granular aggregate formation. In none of the numerous ground-up chondrules could I observe that the tufts ran so directly to the edge, as if the point of emission was outside the sphere, provided that only the same was completely preserved and not a mere shattered piece. The delicate tranversely dividing fibers usually do not run along the entire length of the tuft, but rather they gradually sharpen, branch or end to allow others to take their place, so that in the cross sections, a manifold, mesh-like or netted drawing is created. These fibrils consist, as has often been described above, of a mostly lighter core and a darker envelope, which is more of less dissolved by acids, while the latter resists. Highly curious are the bowl-shaped constructions, which seem to be meteoritic iron, and generally only spread over a smaller part of the globules. The same unilateral striations, visible on the average as cresent bowed streaks, also appear inside the chondrules and provide strong evidence contrary to the chondrules being forming by an unrolling of some material, the entire arrangement of the tufted structure speaks to a resolution against their origin by unrolling. However, not all chrondules are the eccentric fibrous type; many, especially the smaller ones, have a fine-grained composition, as if they are composed of a mass of aggregated dust. Here too, the one-sided formation of the spheres is sometimes noticable by an intensely greater compression of the dust parts."

And further, p. 61:

"The most common type of stony meteorites is predominately that of the so-called chondrites, the composition and structure of which coincide so much that we may not see that the common origin and initial cohesion of these chondrites - if not all meteorites - could be of doubt.

The fact that they enter our atmosphere as highly irregularly shaped pieces — apart from the shattering within the pieces into several fragments, which is common, but can not be assumed in all cases, especially if, by direct observation, the falling of only one piece is confirmed, it can be further concluded that they already make their orbits in the heavenly space as demolished pieces of a single larger celestial body and in their absent-mindedness occasionally fall to Earth when they enter into the area of attraction of the Earth. The lack of original lava like amorphous constituents in connection with the external irregular form is like to exclude from the geo- or cosmological points of view the assumption that these meteorites are ejections of lunar volcanoes, as is often claimed."

Gümbel, having placed the meteorites as related to the olivine rocks of our Earth, summarizes his view on the origin (p. 64) in the sentence: "Therefore, the meteorites appear to be a kind of first process of encasing the celestial bodies, but since they contain metallic iron - to have been produced in the absence of oxygen and water."

So ingenous, he continues (p. 68), "these hypotheses are Daubree's and Tschermak's (origins from shattered volcanic rock), so I can not agree with their view on the formation of the globules (chondrites) on the basis of my latest research. Contrary to Tschermak's assumption, I sought to prove that the internal structure of the chondrules is not out of context with their sphereical shape, and that these globules can not be regarded as pieces of a mineral crystal or solid rock. Even the unsmooth, unpolished surface speaks, which, if formed by abrasion or unrolling, should be mirror-smooth with similar hardness of the material, while it appears rough, bumpy, often facially striated, against the theory of friction, so there is no reason at all by which to understand why the other mineral fragments and are rounded like grains of sand, and why, in particular, the meteorite, the iron, and the very hard chromium iron, as I have been convinced in the meteorite of L'Aigle, are always not rounded, with often extremly finely sliced forms. How is it conceivable that, as if often observed, there would be a concentric accumulation of meteoritic iron within the globules? Also, the excentric fibrous structures of most globules in their one-sided radiating does not appear to be random in relation to the surface, but rather to similar to the nature of the structure of hailstones. This inner structure is closely related to the act of its formation, which can only be explained as a growth of mineral forming substances with simultaneous rotation in gaseous vapors, which provided the material for further support, whereby more material began in the direction of movement."

Gümbel goes on to say that the material constituting the chondrites was formed by a disturbed crystallization and fragmentation resulting from an explosive processes within a space filled with steam and hydrogen gases supplying the minerals. He cloes p. 72 with a discussion of the Kaba meteorite:

"Perhaps, however, it is still possible to prove the presence of organic beings on extraterrestrial bodies." I hope this is successful. From his illustrations one can see that the investigation was based on bad material. After all, more thin sections would have to be made, and the magnification is far from enough. What I refer to is the following description of my tables.

What I value so highly in Gümbel's report is the scrupulous prejudice-free, let's say impartial observations. I have allowed myself to quote the work of Gümbel literally because it is indeed difficult for me to summarize such representations and to separate fact from interpretation.

Proper observations and incorrect explanations are so closely intertwined that it is impossible to do both. I thought when I read Gümbel's paper (after completing my own investigations and manuscript) that I was coming to step on my conclusions at every moment. But as the surge of the surf seizes and throws back the man who wants to win the land every time he thinks he has taken the land, so also here: the old dogma always pulls the honored researcher from the saving cliff into the sea and into the bottomless whirlpool of traditions.

Daubree's commendable work "Experimental Geology" was obtained only in translation and also after completion of my work. No one will find that it refuted my conclusions. Daubree himself depicted Knyahinya. M. pressed, melted, dissolved, calculated, only not — seen.

## Meteorites and their Mineralogical Properties

### 1.

The literature on meteorites is very extensive. However, it is so well known in terms of the type and number of chemical compositions, that I do not need to dwell on this part of it, in particular the earlier works.

### 2.

The meteorites are divided into iron and stone, but there is still a class between the two: "half-iron", i.e. a combination of solid iron and stone - the pallasites. While the irons show many similarities, both in their chemical composition and in the form of their structure, the pallasites are very different (depending on the predominance of iron). But there are other differences among them. Hainholz [mesosiderite], for example, has a blue mineral (enstatite) in addition to iron and olivine, and in this a great richness of life forms. The stones are divided into chondrite, stannerite [Stannern meteorite - eucrite], luotolaxer [Luotolax meteorite - howardite], bokkefelder [Cold Bokkeveld meteorite - carbonaceous], bishopville [Bishopville meteorite - aubrite], (Quenstedt, Klar and Wahr p.280 follow).

I prefer to study the chondrites, and where I speak of meteorites, I am refering to this class of stone meteorites, which is also the most abundant.

I have examined:

Tabor, Böhmen - July 3, 1753  
Siena, Toskana - June 16, 1794  
L'Aigle, Normandy - April 26, 1803  
Weston, Connecticut - December 14, 1807  
Tipperary, Ireland - November 23, 1810  
Blansko, Brünn - November 25, 1833  
Château-Renard, Loiret - July 12, 1841  
Linn County [Marion], Iowa - February 25, 1847  
Cabarras County [Monroe], North Carolina - October 31, 1849  
Mezö-Madaras [Romania] - September 4, 1852  
Borkut, Ungarn - October 13, 1852  
Bremervörde, Hanover - May 13, 1855  
Parnallee, Ostindien - February 28, 1857  
Heredia, Costa Rica - April 1, 1857  
New Concord, Ohio - May 1, 1860  
Knyahinya, Ungarn. - June 9, 1866  
Pultusk, Warschau - January 30, 1868  
Olvinio - August 31, 1872  
Simbirsk

All rocks are thoroughly certified. Above all, I have the kindness of my revered teacher, Professor Dr. [Friedrich August] von Quenstedts, with whom he thankfully commemorate the excellent Tübingen University Collection (which, as is well known, for the most part by [Karl Ludwig] Baron von Reichenbach in Vienna).

### 3.

From Knyahinya I own 360 thin sections, of L'Aigle 6, of Pultusk 6, of the remaining 1 - 3 each. I will name all stones after their place of fall. When making the thin sections, I made the cuts in two directions. After several attempts on Knyahinya, it turned out that it breaks in certain directions. 

This was deduced from the inclusions, which, once their position had been found, regularly resulted in certain forms, to which those forms corresponded in sections made perpendicular to this position.

If the forms were placed on this stone, the same position in the remaining stones would have been obtained, provided, of course, that the material had been available. For some, the same happened by chance, while not in others, but for the reasons stated above further determination in this direction.

Also, I deliberately made the thin sections in three different thicknesses: heavy translucent, in order to see the whole inclusions as complete as possible; very thin, in order to clarify the structural conditions; and for the majority, in such a way that both were still visible.

I would like to make a comment here, which will be confirmed by anyone who has dealt with thin sections of fossiliferous material.

Only in rare cases of total transparency, that are entirely cut thin, is the structure visible. Anyone who looks at a thin section, if cut in this manner, with the microscope will be delighted at the beautiful shapes and lines. In the joy of this, one will want to make things even better and expects with continued grinding a perfect picture. But when one puts the thin section under the microscope after this second time - there is nothing left but an almost structureless surface, with hardly hinted, even blurred shapes, from which you previously perceived with the magnifying glass can no longer be seen, not even with the microscope. However, this phenomenon is related to the type of metamorphosis of the rock and the forms within it. The matter is well known and therefore does not require further explaination. I only mentioned the matter so that those who want to make these observations will not be surprised and will improve their own mode of observation.

The fact that the chondrites consist for the most part of bronzite enstatite (augite) and olivine, as well as being magnetic throughout, is an accepted fact in the science. Quenstedt, Handbook of Mineralogy p. 722.

In particular, however, the inclusions which I claim are coral have been addressed as enstatite. This was believed to be able to explain the such structures. Others went further and explained the inclusions as a type of glass: (Tschermak).

So, before getting to the justification of my view, the microscopic appearance of main mineral, the enstatite, must be clearly identified.

Allow me to give a breif outline of what [Karl Heinrich Ferdinand] Rosenbusch says in his book: Microscopic Physiography of Petrographically Important Minerals, Stuttgart 1873, p. 252, about enstatite (and bronzite): "As is known, since the optical investigations of [Alfred] Des Cloizeaux, the enstatite, bronzite and hypersthene have been treated as rhombic crystallizing separated from the pyroxene and compiled into their own group. In addition to the cleavage after the prism of 87°, the same shows further divisions after the vertical pinacoid, the relative perfection of which the data of the various researchers do not exactly match. Chemically, these three minerals form an uninterrupted series, at the beginning of which stands the almost iron free enstatite, and at the end of which stands the very iron rich hypersthene. Additionally, enstatite and bronzite are so similar in all physical properties that it is difficult to separate them into two species. Hypersthene, on the other hand, shows a different optical orientation and therefore forms its own species. It is interesting to note that Tschermak's arrangement of the negative angles of the optical axes and the iron content of the three minerals mentioned makes it clear that the angle of the optical axes decreases steadily as the [iron oxide] FeO content increases. The microstructure of all the minerals of the enstatite group is generally so similar that, in the special case, a safe decision can only be made by chemical and precise optical analysis."

"Enstatite and bronzite are not found in the rocks as crystals, but almost only in irregularly limited crystalline grains, which usually show a very dense striation, which is more straightforward in the case of enstatite, more gently winding and wave-like. But this difference is not a pervasive one. The same striation is also shown by the monoclinic diopside and rhombic bastite, which can not easily be separated from bronzite by other, later to be discussed, visual phenomena. If the cut meets the enstatite or bronzite at a strong incline to the main cleavage surface, then the surface will not be equally fine-grained, but rather like a rough stairway. Transverse surfaces and fractures are not uncommon."

"Both are relatively poor in extraneous deposits; yes they are missing for example in the enstatite from the pseudophite of the Aloysthals in Mähren and in some enstatites or bronzites of the lherzolites and olivines. The former is traversed only by frequent veins of the pseudophite, from which fine-grained decomposition products penetrate into the enstatite in a vertical direction. Other occurrences and even other individuals of the same hand specimen often contain mass inclusions of green or brown lamallae, splints, and grains (depending on the position of the grinding plane) which, without exception, are invariably parallel to the most perfect cleavage direction. This suggests the idea that various indications on the relative perfection of the pinacoid (inf P inf) cleavage compared with the prismatic one may be due to the more or less mass presence of these interpositions, which undoubtedly also determine the metallic shimmer on the brachypinakoid. Then, however, the ease of separation in this direction would be more a separation than true fissility."

"The enstatite without and the bronzite with metallic shimmer on the brachypinacoid cleavage surface can be found in serpentines of Aloysthal in Mähren (Enstatite) and Mont Bresouars in the Vosges, in the lherzolites and olivine rocks, in some olivine gabbros, in Streng's Enstatitfels from Radauthal near Harzburg and in the olivinite bombs of the Dreiser Weiher [Daun area of Germany], as well as in some meteorites; so always in the company of the olivines and altered olivines."

For those who have command of the book, I provide two illustrations, one of bronzite from Kupferberg (Table 1, Figure 1), the other of enstatite from Texas (Table 1, Figure 2), which are quite similar to Rosenbuschite.

As far as olivine is concerned, there is no need for a picture, since the forms of this mineral are completely encompassed with circles. Suffice it to say that pure olivine does not show any structure. Olivine only shows structure if one wants to call its inclusions or growth sites of the crystal or decomposition phenomena (serpentine formation) structures. However, there is certainly no crystal that looks similar to my forms. As for the claim that the spheres are glass, it is not even made clear what chemical composition these glass spheres [chondrules] should have compared with enstatite, bronzite, and olivine. Apparently, all forms are thrown together and delcared as glass, although enstatite according to Quenstedt (Mineralogy p. 318) is infusible, according to Naumann-Zirkel p. 585 it is, at least, difficult to melt. It is even claimed that these glass spheres were first created while falling. But the effects of fire are found only in the [fusion] crust. The [fusion] crust of most meteorites is barely 2 mm in diameter.

The assertion, that they [chondrules] were glass, countered by the message sent from my thin sections, was the reply of the similarity of the meteoritic form to such glass in the rocks of our Earth. So I was referred by [Ferdinand] Zirkel to a spherulite liparite, of which I give (Table 1, Figure 3). This form should show that my urania is a deception. I think the form in the liparite is crystallite formation (probably zeolite). Now look at the structures next on Table 1, Figures 4, 5, 6!

Our researchers, with the exception of Gümbel, speak of the meteorites as volcanic bombs, declaring the rock as identical to the volcanic rocks of the Earth, so counting the meteorite without hesitation with the volcanic rocks. The evidence to the contrary is the subject of this book.

Rightly Quenstedt has alone has declared the question an open one and said: "...it is reserved for the microscope to solve the riddle of the composition of the meteorites!" Handbook of Mineralogy p. 722.

# Section II

## The Organic Nature of the Chondrite

### Chapter I

#### Organic or Inorganic?

In order to prove that a plant or animal organism is present, I consider it necessary to prove:
1. a unified form,
2. a recurring form,
3. recurring in developmental stages,
4. structure, either cells or vessels,
5. similarity to known forms.

If these requirements are valid, it remains only to decide, whether plant or animal? Now you ask yourself, do my forms fulfill these requirements?

I believe, before I go to the positive proof, the negative proof ought to lead.

The proof you see, that I claim for the existence of organic beings is twofold: a negative one, by showing that the meteoritic forms do not belong to the mineral kingdom, and a positive one, by showing the similiarity of the meteoritic forms with the forms of our Earth, whether living or extinct. The first thing to prove, therefore, is the sentence: 

The inclusions of the meteorites are not mineral formations.

1\. Our mineralogists explain the inclusions of chondrites as enstatite, bronzite, and olivine.

Olivine has no visible sheet breakage, enstatite and bronzite it is obvious. I depict a bronzite from Kupferberg, Table 1 Figure 1, an enstatite from Texas, Table 1 Figure 2 (thin section at 75 times magnification) Figure 2 shows one the best sheet fractures. Now first compare this with Table I. Figure 4, a part of one of my favorites from the Knyahinya Meteorite (about 250 times enlarged) and you will probably no longer speak about the fact that the sheet breakage is the cause of the structural phenomena of the chondrite. Now look at all the tables and this explanation will be put aside once and for all.

2\. If the inclusions of the chondrites consist of enstatite or olivine, or if they are glass: If that is the case, I ask, how is it possible that the same mineral, or glass as a whole occur, in such different forms (outlines and structures), and different minerals occur in such acutely coinciding forms?  Look at a hypersthene, a hornblende, an augite! Apart from some visible, easy-to-explain inclusions — (and this is not the case here) always the same picture! Of at most three minerals a hundred different images!

A mineral is simple, it must be simple in its concept and therefore always gives the picture of a homogeneous mass (field), with some inclusions at most. How could the same mineral be present in such different structures, in such coherent forms that differ from crystal forms?

3\. Minerals are either crystallized or not crystallized. In the first order they have a certain regular and recurrent form: they move on surfaces which, on average, project themselves as straight lines. These forms (lines and angles) are recurring, varying only in size, not ratio. Such forms are not found among the forms I have addressed as organic. In the orgranic forms there is no form with a surface or an angle; all are spheres or ellipses with deviations from the mathematical form, deviations, which are nevertheless constant. It is these other forms which give rise to the need to forsee just what are these matching structures, showing themselves with constant outlines, these forms which are different from the crystal form of the enstatites and the olivines.

Though they are rare, small sections are real crystals, but in a way, they are probative values that do not impinge on the facts. See below and Table 32, Figure 2.

4\. If the minerals were originally crystallized, but happen to lose their crystalline form due to some mechanical force, the only form that could be repeated is the sphere or one approaching it, such as an ellipse. Here a repetition would be possible without a conclusion being drawn about the form. In these spheres, surface cuts of the body would immediately show the influence of such mechanical forces, in particular, the inclusions would be hit arbitrarily.

However, the structure in the meteorite inclusions is always, I would like to say: symmetric, in harmony with its outlines.

5\. When the crystals are weathered the layers change from the outside to the inside - concentrically - but there is no trace of weathering in the inclusions of the chondrites and their structures are always eccentric.

6\. Regarding the mineral inclusions, they give different sights depending on their nature. The deposits are quite arbitrary forms, such as glass-liquid-inclusions and crystallites.

But where crystal laws appears in the inclusions, they always depends on the crystalline form. Neither is the case with meteorite forms. No trace of inclusions in accordance with a crystalline form!

7\. A sheet breakage is only visible if mechanical force creates a surface for light refraction phenomena. Without this, it is imperceptible. If cleavage surfaces are not present, light refraction phenomena do not show the meteorite inclusions, just "dust material".

One finds in the terrestrial minerals that there are interpositions parallel to the sheet cleavage: these do not show in the meteorites.

I believe that the sight of my forms will make further discussion about the diversity of mineral and, in particular, crystal images unnecessary.

8\. But so much has been said of crystallites, of crystallization.

It has been previously held that such crystallization will turn into the enstatite-bronzite-olivine spheres. Gümbel pointed out that there all spheres have eccentric centers!

Here the tread of the basic difference between the meteorite forms and the crystallites is made quite clear.

The crystallites always grow around one point (concentric). The forms in the meteorites are all elliptical and pear-shaped: if the outer form is also spherical, the alleged inclusions are eccentrically arranged and the center lies on the periphery (even beyond it, namely, which it is ground away, which Gümbel overlooked) - a phenomenon that never occurs in the mineral kingdom. It is precisely the condition of crystallites, i.e. sphere formation, that the crystals unite with a crystal of equal mass, which then create concentric forms.

Therefore if the spheres in the meteorites were crystallites, then, at least according to the laws of Earth, concentric formations would show.

9\. Finally, I must point out a contradiction that science came up with in order to explain the structure of the chondrites as being a mineral property. This is the optical behavior of these inclusions.

If they were crystals and had broken sheets (of course olivine has none, yet there are structures in the alleged olivine sphere structures, i.e. sheet fracture!) as the source of their structure, the mineral should by necessity break light. In most of the inclusions, however, there is no refraction of light, not even aggregate polarization! So they can neither be simple minerals nor crystals, nor, least of all, be sheet fracture structures. This matter, that of the optical behavior, should have already led to the correct interpretation.

All this evidence is of course unknown to the botanist and zoologist, while every mineralogist knows it. Therefore I must ask the botanist and zoologist colleague to confirm what my photographs show. These forms are not mineral forms. With this the mineralogist has done his part, and now it passes into the hands of the paleontologist, or rather the zoologist, and now begins the positive proof.

### Chapter II

#### The Individual Forms

##### A. Sponge

###### 1. Urania

Round, lobed bodies with an obvious place of growth. Table 2 gives a larger image of an Urania (compared with Table 5, Fig. 1, the same picture). One sees here: the acute general form, the outermost lobed edge (white, on the left), the folds, which develop while contracting, the place of growth. Even more clearly is the latter as a chalice, Table 4, Figure 3.

Consolidated spiral-form Urania Table 3, Figure 5 and 6.

In comprehending the threads of Table 4, Figure 1: the structure consists of an outer skin enclosing lamellar layers Table 3, Figure 4. Table 4, Figure 6 (the latter can be seen with a magnifying glass). Median diameter of Urania 1 mm, color slate gray.

This structure was maintained to be a breakage of the bronzite sheet! Whether Table 4, Figure 4 belongs to the Urania is doubtful. The form and color suggest as much. The trim cuts on boths sides show clear structure.

Table 5, Figure 5 shows entirely winding lobes. Either it is a hoisted spiral-form body or it is several lobes, of which the outer one surrounds the inner.

Table 4, Figure 6 is a cross section, which does not show much. In the object itself you can see an average uncolored outer thin shell.

Table 5, Figure 2 shows such clear stratification, that if the outer form did not exist, one might attempt to place the form as coral. 

Table 4, Figure 5 shows cross sections through both vanes of the lobes.

Table 6, Figure 3 lamellar structure. Figure 5 and 6 may also contain the simplest crinoids, whose arms have been laid out, on each other. Regarding the transitions of forms, I must refer to the chapter on that question.

The most incredible is Table 6, Figure 1 and 2. In figure 1, the dull spot in the specimen is yellow, the striped blue. I have situated Figure 2 next, which clearly shows two lobes, connected like two shells in one place and at first sight also makes the impression of a double shell. (It is not a mere cut.) If you think a shell, the dull spot of Figure 1 would be the stone piece. But the structure is urania-like.

Table 5, Figure 3: Two individuals show the structure most clearly, as well as the growth points. In Figure 4 (which has a bad picture), several individuals lie together in a fan-like manner.

In Table 3, Figure 3 and Table 4, Figures 1 and 2, it is believed to be seen the round mouth opening as implied from above. 

After all this I think the Urania is a sessile sponge, that contracts in a spiral form, absorbing and expelling water like our living sponges.

Urania composes three twentieths of the rock mass. 

###### 2. Needle-Sponge

Table 7, the forms of Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 show a spicule framework. Figure 1 points to Astrospongia. The needles are regularly crossed. Figure 6 is an irregularly massive spicule framework with a cavity, which from the picture suggests is very weak. These two forms seem unquestionable to me.

Almost certain are Figures 2 and 5 (in Figure 2, the white line is a rock crack).

The shape of Figure 4 I kept in the arrangement of tables as a sponge. After changing the arrangement was no longer possible, I realized this form was the skewed average of a crinoid and what I initially considered to be needles - are fine crinoid arms. I note that the determination is very difficult because of the exceptionally plain meteoritic crinoid forms, which means a decision must be avoided pending further investigation. The cavity of the needle sponge can be confused for the food channel of the crinoid arms, when the latter are stretched straight and the limbs are no longer clearly preserved. This fact of the matter, however unpleasent for the investigator of individual forms, is all the more rewarding for the one who pursues the development of the forms - for proving the development of one form to another. It is always enough one to the other. This puts us in a more favorable position.

##### B. Coral

Here we have such well preserved terrestrial forms that not a doubt is left remaining.

Table 8 shows a sample image, Table 9 its canal structure: obvious bud canals, which are tubular connections (for there are such). In addition, there is a curvature of the canals, which absolutely can not be mistaken for sheet breakage, plus there is the very clear tube openings and finally the equally clear growth site. (Table 1, Figure 4 shows an even sharper picture of the same object.) Regrettably, staining of the specimen gives the structure pictured in Table 9, such digusting shadows. The bud canals are 0.003 mm apart. Of course, everything you can ask for from a Favosites structure.

Table 10, Figures 3 and 4 show us the image of Favosites multiformis from the Silurian, in this one can not even separate the species.

On Table 11 in Figures 1, 2, and 3 (where 2 also shows the growth points), any researcher will easily recognize the image of living coral forms, the more so as the cup shape (cavity) is indicated in Figure 1 above. The same object also shows the cross partitions of the tubes, which clearly emerge. Unfortunately, part of the picture is obscured by black in the photograph due to the yellow coloring used on the specimen.

Table 10, Figures 1 and 2 show less well-preserved cross-wise and longitudinal sections, though the exact same repetition of both in several sections raises the doubts that they are organic forms, and if they are such, then they can only be corals. Figure 3 seems to be a cup coral, Figure 4 has grown the same. The fact that Figure 6 has a coral structure does not require proof. This form recurrs several times.

Table 11, Figure 4 This form also recurrs several times. Peculiar coral forms are shown in Figures 5 and 6. Figure 5 is formed of tubular rings and most likely also Figure 6. I note that this shape appears hundreds of times.

At high magnification, partitions show: Table 11, Figures 1, 2, 3, and 6. Table 12, Figures 1 thru 3 show clear lamellar structure. The transverse groove in Figure 4 is reminiscent of Fungia. Table 30, Figures 1 and 2 and Table 20 probably also belong here.

The coincidence of the structure in Table 20 with that in Table 30, Figure 1 (in two different cut preparations) would alone suffice to exclude any possible thought of inorganic formation. Moreover, the form occurs about twenty times in the 350 cuts.

Table 12, Figure 5 I found only once. In the original there are clear lamellae, which in the picture appear only in the lower part. Figure 6 is a milky white object, hence indistinct. I believe I recognize the star shape and have therefore placed the form here as a star coral.

Table 13, Figures 1 thru 4 are corals which undoubtedly belong with the tubular corals. In the original, one can clearly distinguish: glassy like intermediate masses, black tube walls, yellow tubular filling material, occasionally the latter is also black. This form occurs a hundredfold in all the chondrites. Figure 5 is composed of lamellas showing clear cavities and Figure 6 has tubes with partitions. These forms belong with the largest of forms: they have diameters up to 3 mm.

In Table 25, Figures 1 and 2 the form is here so well-preserved that the existence of an organism could not be doubted, the more so because it occurs in two cuts and otherwise recurs frequently. See Table 2, lower left, Table 5, Figure 6 has the form, Table 1, Figure 6 and Table 25, Figures 1 and 2 posed in sequence with the crinoids; the canals are unquestionable, the cross lines can also be interpreted as crinoid links. You can see incisions, furthermore the arms are broken, which can only be associated with crinoids.

Broken or kinked arms also appear in Table 25, Figure 4 with this form there are multiple examples, which give precisely the same image.

All coral forms throughout make up about a twentieth the total volume of the chondrite rock, but constituting the remaining sixteen twentieths, that which is by far the greatest part of the whole mass:

##### C. Crinoids

They are found in the simplest form, from their articulately divided arms to the developed crinoid with stem, crown, main and auxiliary arms. Their preservation is good for the most part. The difficulty lies only in the thousands of possible directions of cutting, which always give different perspectives of the same object. The pear-shaped bodies, which are regarded as glass are crinoids - their crowns.

I present four crinoids in an upright position and in high quality in Tables 16 thru 19 and in profile Table 20.

Table 21, Figures 1 thru 5 show average vertical sections of more developed crinoids. These are the main arms with auxillary arms and distinct joint surfaces.

Table 21, Figure 3 shows steam and crown. (Figures 2 and 4 have double the magnification of 1 and 3.) Figure 5, from another thin section, is shown to display the conformity of the forms. In Figure 6 I believe to perceive the mouth opening in the cusp between the arms.

Table 22, Figures 1, 3, 4, and 5 and Table 23, Figures 1 and 2 show 5 as the number of arms, as well as with the auxiliary arms.

In Table 23, Figures 2 and 3 shows the kinking of arms due to pressure from above.

Table 22, Figures 2 and 4 calls to mind Comatulida.

A particular species of crinoids, which consist only of a number of arms. These are seen in Table 23, Figures 4 and 5, Table 24, Figures 4, 5, and 6. Table 26 (The picture on Table 24, Figure 6 is a smaller scale of the coral from Cabarras, Table 13, Figure 6.)

Table 29, Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 and Table 27, Figure 3 show pictures of crinoids as seen from above.

Table 27, Figure 2 and Table 29, Figure 4 show crinoids from below: here the base of the stem emerges as a bright spot. The cross sectional cuts give dozens of cases showing a consistent form. (See also Table 3, Figure 2, top left. Finer results could probably not have been asked for: the muscle layers are clearly visible here.)

Peculiar entanglements are shown in Table 26, Figures 1 thru 4.

The clearest profiles are given in Table 25, Figures 5 and 6. Table 27, Figure 3 is a longitudinal profile with broken arms.

Table 24, Figures 1 and 2 are forms, which I first viewed as coral. Table 28, Figure 1 could, nevertheless, be added to the latter. (the structure should be more clearly preserved in order for a final decision to be made).

A little clearer is Table 27, Figure 1: an apparent outer casing, which is nothing but regular closed main arms.

An exceptionally nice picture is given in Table 30, Figure 3; whether crinoid? this is doubtful. I only take notice, the two parts are symmetrical and the arms are not placed beside each other, rather they cross.

Table 30, Figure 5 with a cut, I had at first placed as urania. It shall be added to the crinoids.

Table 31, Figures 1 thru 3 appear to be similar forms. In Figures 1 and 3 one can perceive a distinct furrow, perhaps this is the place where two crinoid arms lie against one another. With the polarization device, the furrow appears even more clearly. In Figure 4, two individuals are merged, leaving it open to interpretation as either sponge or coral. Figure 5 has a structure in the middle part, some structure tissue, showing the upper arms as distinct structures. Do these belong together? Since the form only occurs once, I dare not make a final decision. The resemblance of the central image with the structure of the schreibersite in meteorites is striking. Figure 6 is found twice, so that I consider both parts as related.

The same mesh structure is shown in Table 30, Figure 6 at increased magnification. The structure of both is agreed, as suggested before, with the structure of the schreibersite in the meteorites and makes an appearance several times.

As I already noted in the beginning, I do not consider my task here to enumerate species. My task is only to establish the existence of organisms by proving unified recurring forms of undoubted organic structure. I think that I have done this and I think that no one should have even the slightest doubt (especially after viewing the original in thin section) that these do not act as minerals. Even if only five organic forms were verified without a doubt, the other less well preserved forms would also be organic.

The final determination of the genera and even the species requires more material and years of investigation. (I will be grateful for the former.) Above all, I should have more time than the current night hours and more strength than my current strenuous profession leaves me to finish my work. I think I have given the required points asked for, on which one can stand. In conclusion, I refer to the table commentary.

Thus the forms are presented. I have been pursuing a plan, of making a statistical study on the occurance of the forms, to count out something such as the occurance of same forms that one finds in 500 thin sections. I bring this up, because I felt I had to say, that I did not think such would have a great value. Each multiplication of my collection by twelve new ones would change the ratio. I therefore preferred to give an approximate numerical ratio for the individual forms.

### Chapter III

#### All Life

The individual forms were brought to view in the previous sections. All of these forms are not buried upon death, but the one grows upon another and in truth they are buried alive by life. Here of course only our vision can provide conviction. To this purpose one should look in all the pictures at the individual forms within their surroundings!

What at first glance appears as a bright spot, upon closer examination shows on the average a sponge, a coral, or a crinoid part. Nowhere are, as Gümbel has quite rightly observed, there disassembled, rolled off forms and fragments - also there is not a binder between them. Only soft tissues are missing, everything else is preserved, just as it was when the life was in water. The crinoid forms show this clearly. For these are at most curved on a side, winding, and seldom broken; one sees also that there was only weak mechanical resistance against neighbouring heads. But everything together, grown apart - nothing laid down, nothing buried. There is also no mass available which could have consituted a grave.

The fact, that there is nothing inorganic in the chondrite rocks, and not a single place without life in it, I consider to be as important as the existence of the organisms themselves. First, this fact casts full light on the emergence of the planets. If one adds to this, that the rock, which includes these formations, consists of minerals, belonging to the purported primary mountains [Urgestein], yes "volcanism" associated with the mountains: then our geology must take a different path in the explanation of the facts. My belief is by no means that the sponges, corals, and crinoids are from the minerals we have here, which constitute forms today. The original organisms must have been composed differently, they must have endured a transformation.

It is so much, I think, beyond all doubt, that what is nowadays hornblende, augite, and olivine are what filled the referred-to forms, formerly these minerals must have been in a different condition, namely a liquid water one, a water solution.

Now we find these minerals in our primary mountains as forms, which are not crystals, but are similar to meteoritic ones. We find mountain masses composed of such forms. So here too it is highly probable that organic forms, subsequently transformed, are what we now call rocks. These rocks, however, points to a layer which is undoubtedly close to the meteoritic (chondritic), indeed they are closely related. Under this must lie the iron. This testifies to the specific weight of the Earth. Again the identical situation appears in the fallen iron meteorites: here, as in the Ovifak rock, we find transitions, compositions of iron and olivine.

This gives us the greatest baseline for geology - we have the chronological development of the body of the Earth. The development of form - the reason for the growth of the forms themselves is at the same time open. If the organism in the lowest layer, that we know, was the source of mass creation, it could also have been the initial cause for the beginning of the planet itself. The assumption of mere mass-attraction, the mechanical formation of the Earth and the heavenly bodies would in general, be thereby refuted.

Admittedly organisms in iron, in the Earth's core, and in the meteoritic iron must also be detected. It is this task which I set for myself in what follows next. The previous results allow for a hopeful solution.

### Chapter IV

#### Stone in the Stone

When I said this: the chondrite is nothing but a weave of animals, a mat of animals, a qualification must be suffered.

There are, however, very small, sharply outlined places in this animal-bone stone, which could probably (but not necessary) be from the beginning rocks. These are slate-blue, uncommon inclusions with 3 - 5 mm. diameters lacking definite recurring forms, which include distinct cystals in their grayish mass, these are on average either squares or rhombuses, at other times it includes hexagons. This mineral can be either augite or olivine. Here the crystalline form pronounces in favor of a mineral. The sole existence of this speaks for my views. Why have the crystals not grown themselves identically everywhere? And why should there not be hollow cavities remaining in the organisms? It is known that fillers in organic forms later crystallize. And, in the end-filled organic forms cavities are found, in which their outlines look like surfaces recessing at an angle.

The reason, for why I acknowledge that these inclusions are inorganic parts of the chondrites, as actual meteoritic stone (sone in the stone), is, since the outlines do not give the indication, that their form does not address itself as being organic. These inclusions may be deposits of an already developed rocky mass or they may have only developed in the cavities.

This situation is possible, even probable, that it was a falling-in of pieces of already deposited rock, that were fully developed, and does not need to be denied: it does not knock on the fact, that in the olivine strata formations exist and that these are the cause of the construction of the planet bodies, their self-constructed development and complex composition.

Under all circumstances, however, the ratio in the chondritic rock is the opposite as that in the sedimentary layers of our Earth. In these are the organisms stored, the rock strata enclose them; there is simply nothing but organisms and the rock strata are masses of such. I put an image of an actual rock-pieces in Borkut [Ukraine]. Table 32, Figure 2 next to that (Figure 1) I have depicted a form, slate-blue like Urania, however, without a set structure, also their outlines are inconsistent, which could be the lack of filler. If it were an organic form, it would be of the lowest nature. For comparison I show in Table 32, Figure 4 a thin section of Lias γ𝛿 [Early Jurassic] (Zwischenkalk), here shells are located in limestone, but most parts are merely pieces of shells; the parts are crushed in all sizes, and, regarding their origin, they are tumbled beyond any recognition. In the chondrite there is no place left which can leave doubt as to their composition.

### Chapter V

#### Reproduction

In the stone there are found a host of round and pear-shapred forms with 0.10 mm. - 0.50 mm. diameters, which barely indicate structure. I hold these forms to be the first development forms. Among the many forms, the most outstanding is the transparent spherical forms of rock, in the center of which are canal openings. Here one finds these canals within spheres, with two further below and a larger above, and so forth on up to the forms of Table 13, Figures 1 thru 4. The case is here, I believe, secure. This form is not only evident in all the chondrites, in all one also finds in them all the developmental stages in the up to 20 or more canals: they are common and at the same time certain, because of their self-evident canal structure. They have been preserved in those chondrites which hardly show the forms on the left. The development that is suggested here is that the canals reproduce.

Of course, there are many faint spherical and pear shapes which indicate structure. They appear to have been of sarcode [gelatinous material], when they were at once interred. I would not dare to bring these forms up if they did not indicate a definite structure. They consist of two, three, four, and five lobed-form branches and are probably the beginnings of crinoids. That the observation of developmental forms is difficult is well known. Hence, this is why I do not allow myself to act prematurely here. What I say here should only be considered a pointer towards future research.

Good preservation is an impossiblity. This is because meteoritic forms face the same destiny of living animals: it is always the ultimate labor to find that first beginning of developement, the embryo.

I will refer to a single fact here, which is a considerable point of proof for the organic nature of the forms: the always occurring assocation of the individual forms. Many forms that one finds collectively resemble each other: few stand individually and at the same time as a unit. I hold this as highly significant. If several individuals of the same species come together, it goes to follow from this, that there stands mother or sibling relationships. The same phenomenon is known to occur in the terrestrial type. This would seem to signify, as minerals often do, to which form it belongs, undoubtedly the same applies to other species mineral filling, so a mineralogical ground from which the difference derivative of structure coud be inferred.

#### Development

After having depicted the single forms, I now must discuss their proportions to each other, the development of the unfolding of forms.

That Urania is the simplest form, this is certain. However, it establishes the inception of what follows.

These layers in the hemispherical lobes, these tubular layers, they part themselves crosswise - which nowadays would constitute the arm, connects a canal. It develops a crown between the arms and the growth point and the simplest crinoid is there. If this seems like a twisted chain of events, the forms involuntarily demand it. But just as we necessarily find somewhere in living forms a line of development, so should we also not find that the same changes have taken place here? Certainly. Only, I believe, they are found with more quantity and much greater visibility of transitions in the meteoritic forms. One can find the ancestor of the Pentacrinus Briareus nowhere else on Earth except with the corals, and one can see the origin of the coral in the sponge form: it is decidedly a lower form than that of the coral.

What this meteorite-creation gives of such great importance to the evolutionary theory is not only the occurance of animal forms in the deepest strata, but also consistent types for all meteoritic organisms. This becomes clear after ones views hundreds of thin sections one after the other.

The scale of the organisms is uniform, at least one thousand times smaller than the ones on the Earth: the development of the individual forms attain approximately equal highest points. The construction of the forms correspond perfectly with the circumstances, under which they grew, namely the extremely shortened life time, which was an experience it had: it is a hasty, relatively incomplete creation. The crinoid is the highest representative of this animal world. I hold that the most advanced is the form in Table 22, Figures 1, 3, 5, and 6, because he really embodies the five number.

One will not want to go so far, however, as to derive the crinoids through the corals, so the form of the Urania must offer some clue. I show some forms which have the loose branches. They are indicated in their descriptions. In particular, I find at high magnification overlying arms.

Even here an adequate observation of a single is not enough for a complete conclusion.

# Section III

## Meteoritic Iron

As I have already indicated in my "Primordial Cell", the structure of the meteoritic irons is nothing other than a single mat of unicellular plants. The so-called Widmanstätten figures are, for the most part nothing other than these unicellular plants.

A piece of the Toluca iron meteorite lies in front of me, in which the cylindrical cells alternately emerge from each other, the two are often copulated. The individual cells show a double cell wall (iron band), show cross partitioning, show clear round root points; in some there is a marrow substance (which it is really called), indeed, in the inside of the cell there is yet more structure. All of the cells lie in a mat of filler (iron-filler).

Compare these figures with the forms of the Lias slate, especially Algacites [Fucoides] granulatus and ask yourself, of the two, which one shows a plant structure clearest, the Toluca iron or the Algacites [Fucoides] from Lias-Epsilon?

These forms are cylindrical, from time to time one sees (on average) approximately polyhedral surfaces: they have walls. What especially distinguishes them from crystals (which can be foreseen from the round forms) are the growth sites.

Crystals, which grow together, set themselves against one particular crystal surface as well along particular surfaces, (dendrites of silver, copper); they place themselves along the surfaces of another, without entering into them, but in the meteoritic iron one finds penetration instead. The cross section is not a straight line (crystal surface), but a curve.

Here ends all similarities with crystals, unless one assumes that there could be cylindrical crystals, which grow out of each other. The claim, that these figures have fixed mathematical positions, may be correct here and there by chance; all researchers allow this alone, that nowhere are the angles constant, which with dendrites is always the case. If one finds a place, out of which an octahedron, a cube, or a different regular crystal form derive their location, even a rhombohedron: immediately the order compared with another is quite different. And how can one speak of crystal laws, when from identical minerals not once has this fixed crystal system been repeated? Because one finds, as I have said, rhombohedral slices next to regular ones.

I find just two objections that seem to be justified:

1\. The objection, that the figures are occasional sheets:
